### Projects 
> I worked on a project called 'Semester Tracker' for my Software Engineering paper at Otago Polytechnic. This project was very php and html based so I had to be able to learn these languages very quickle as I have had no experience with php and almost none with html. Semester track is a website you can use to track many things such as assignments and other important dates. It is designed for students and teacher, where the teacher have the ability to add their class dates and assignment deadlines up for all to see.
