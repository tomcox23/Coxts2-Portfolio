### My professional Proficiencies during the project

> Throughout the semester tracker project, I have discovered a lot about how I really work in a team environment particularly when I am one of the least experienced or talented members within a team. I found this project very challenging as it was heavily based around html and php. Two subjects I have had no experience with especially php. As a result, I found myself guiltily letting other members do the harder tasks especially during sprints three to five. I did this because I thought I would be able to catch up to the others in terms of knowledge and ability so that I could be more useful later when the tasks became more and more challenging. This worked and didn’t work. 

>During the initial sprints one and two I was able to get my tasks completed and generally to a high standard because there was plenty of material I could use. This helped me code html and learn the best ways to create a responsive design. I learnt quickly and took full advantage of agile principle ten “Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.” I used code that had already been made which only required small adjustments to make work on our site. This meant that for example the FAQ page I made had a very responsive design from the start. 

> Reflecting on this I learnt an important lesson here about communication and conflict within a team. I mentioned to my team multiple times that we should try not make everything from scratch and that making the design responsive from the start would benefit us in the future. I brought this up multiple times during our first couple of scrums and bigger meetings where we discussed the design of the site. To my surprise the more capable members of the group proceeded to suggest hard coding the site in terms of width sizes and other variables and proceeded to do exactly that. This would contribute to the unresponsive state of our current site. Furthermore, it caused us to get less work done in the future because finding out why the site wasn’t responsive and fixing it took two sprints worth of problem solving. It also meant we didn’t have proper working software to show our customer.

>I realise now that I did not communicate very well to the other team members about this issue. Because html and php were completely new to me, I struggled to back up my reasons for wanting to do something a certain way. I found it difficult to present my ideas to certain members who were very smart but strongly opinionated, so I often did not speak my mind. I could have used slack to communicate how important it was to make a responsive site from the start. This would have allowed me to prepare a good statement and let it be seen by all members.

Looking at our Sprint one retrospectives for example  

#### What went well?
***
* Scrums- Timing and frequency seems to fit our schedules.
* Everyone knew exactly what they needed to do. We had a meeting clarifying this near the start of the sprint.
* Everyone was motivated. Partially by having scrums so often.
* Collaborating in class so we were all aware of each other’s work.
* Wiki having updated information to keep things consistent and links in one place.
* Communication on Slack for instant communication and having discussions on GitHub for content related discussions.


### What needs to be changed
***

* Communicating about coming to meetings!!!
* Testing CSS on different sizes.
* People not communicating in chat
* More thorough reviewing of each other's work
* Create deadlines earlier in the sprint
* More group agreed upon deadlines.
* Create a timeline for sprints
* More thorough discussion about everyone’s duties earlier in the sprint 

> This example shows our team had both good and bad communication. This was a regular theme that presented itself in every retrospective. A point about communication was always made in the “what went well” sections and “what needs to be changed” section. I thought we had very effective scrums and meetings. These were held on a regular basis to know what each member was up too or was having issues.  We managed to find convenient times to have the meetings that worked for everyone. Proving agile principle six “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.” to be very relevant in our team. When it came to communicating away from each other we all struggled at points for various reasons. I personally struggled with using slack as I often missed information that was being posted. This was because my phone would never notify me if someone posted a message. I did have the other members try help me find a solution to my notification problem but unfortunately, we were unsuccessful. I did try to check slack a couple times a day but there were still many times I would not see posted messages. 

> There were many times where our slack messaging was very effective. For example, Josh had made a mistake whilst merging his branch into the master late at night and was unsure of how to fix the merge. I had made a similar mistake on a smaller scale earlier that day, so I was able to communicate with him clearly about how to fix the merge. Several other occasions occurred where using slack we were able to arrange impromptu meetings to all chip in and fix a problem that was occurring.  Or meet up to work on testing the site.

> Time Management is an important skill in a small project group. Within a week of our first sprint we came realized meeting every single day was not going to be a viable option. Mainly Monday as most of us did not have class and would not be at Polytec. A solution was quickly thought of and discussed to finalize our regular meeting times.  During each Sprint we wrote out usually the same timetable as below each week in our wiki page. It was written on the wiki page as it as the easiest place to find and look at. Example from out Wiki records (sprint 1).

### Meeting Times and Locations:
***
Here are the meeting times we have previously agreed to.
* Monday: 10:00am- Currently on hold until further notice
* Tuesday: 10:00am - D201 -Software engineering class
* Wednesday: 12:50pm(approx) - Common Room
* Thursday: 3:00pm - D201-Software engineering class
* Friday: 12:00pm(approx) - After Programming 4

> This would really help us in the long run because we would not have to message each other to organise a meeting we could just turn up. Making things very easy and streamlined. Below is an example of how we managed our deadlines. 

### Current Deadlines 
***
Here are the deadlines we currently would like to meet:

* Monday 13th: Everyone submit their work for review
* Thursday 16th: All Editing finished before class at 3pm

> We learnt that trying to have one dead line was not going to allow us to be agile. We implemented two deadlines. One set on each Monday to have all work submitted for review, which allowed us to check each other’s committed code for example. After a ticket has been moved to the review area on the Kanban board another team member would look at what they have submitted make sure it functions properly and make sure the code fits with our style. Here is an example of me doing this process.

> Having these deadlines increased the teams time management and our own personal time management and allowed us to achieve Agile principle’s one “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”, two “Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.”, three “Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.” And eight “Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.”.

> These deadlines helped my motivation as I felt like I was letting the team down if I did not get my work done by Monday ready for review. I had several three-hour blocks between classes each week. This was when I got most of my work done. Weekends I used to check and commit what I had finished ready for review on Monday. As a result, we were able to work together on the Tuesday class merging our branches and helping team members if they had fallen behind. This allowed us to present a working program to the customers two days before our sprint deadline.  This was a positive for our team because the customers could give us feedback on the work we had done and have the chance to have parts of the site changed. I believe our sprint velocity was also kept high at around 60-70 and peaking in sprint seven at 93. Due to the deadlines we were able to show that we could maintain a constant pace of development.

> I think overall our team worked effectively to deliver working software and problem solving. Most big issues or problems that came up involved either all of us sitting down to figure out a solution or a couple of us. Claire, Sam and Carthur were all currently doing papers about php, so they were the go-to for help with php related problems. It made sense to give them the most challenging tickets that involved php. I was still able to help when php problems came up, but my main areas were working on the html and CSS Related tasks as I was most familiar with that as well as Laravel. I also became more involved in difficult tasks when merge conflicts and a weird permissions error occurred whilst trying to push our work up. Josh and I were familiar with Linux systems. Therefore We were able to work together to identify and change the permissions of a certain file to grant it write permissions. When Issues were being resolved I or josh were the go-to people to help as we were confident navigating the command line which helped a lot when using gitbash. 

> A personal development I made through this project experience would be the way commit my code. At the start I tended to do one big commit with everything done. This was generally poor practice on my behalf and I did get more regular at committing my work here is a comparison for how I committed at the start and towards our later sprints.

> This shows I was committing work in one big commit which goes against agile principle’s one and three as mentions above. Committing regularly throughout your work ensures that you have back ups if something goes wrong and shows a progression of working software. This is an example of my later committing practices.

> My committing becomes much more consistent in smaller chucks which is a much better way to work. It shows that I am also regularly doing work and added useful additions to the software which means that if we were to show our clients what work has been done, we would have more to show them.
